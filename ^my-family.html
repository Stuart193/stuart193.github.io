            <a class="header1">My heritage<br></a>
            <a class="story1">I have the tremendous and under-appreciated blessing of having a wonderful Christian
                heritage. All of my immediate ancestors have been active and unabashed Christians. In most of my family
                lines, the members have been Christians for generations. In addition, all of my family, for at least 4
                generation, have lived within a 50-mile circle (some south of the Mason-Dixon, some north- I
                digress!)<br><br></a>
            <a class="header2">My parents<br></a>
            <a class="story2">My parents grew up two doors from each other, but never considered marriage. One day
                something clicked, and they've been married for 22 years now! Both are strong Christians, involved in
                our local church and living out our faith. I'm grateful for the upbringing I and my siblings have had
                (and are having). My dad works for our state's Department of Agriculture, and my mom works at home and
                puts up with us!<br><br></a>
            <a class="header3">My siblings<br></a>
            <a class="story3">I have 3 siblings: one brother and two sisters. All 3 have been saved, and the peace that
                comes from having one's family all saved is amazing. My brother is one year younger than I, my first
                sister 3, and my second sister 6. We generally get along well together, but with an occational "friendly
                rivalry." All four of us have been and are homeschooled, so we're around each other much more and are
                each other's best friends. It's actually really nice!
