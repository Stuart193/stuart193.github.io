        VERSE 1-Brethren, we have met to worship
        <br>and adore the Lord our God.
        <br>Will you pray with all your power
        <br>while we try to preach the Word?
        <br>All is vain unless the Spirit
        <br>of the Holy One comes down.
        <br>Brethren, pray, and holy manna
        <br>will be showered all around.
        <br><br>VERSE 2-Brethren, see poor sinners ‘round you
        <br>slumb’ring on the brink of woe.
        <br>Death is coming, Hell is moving-
        <br>can you bear to let them go?
        <br>See our fathers and our mothers
        <br>and our children sinking down.
        <br>Brethren, pray, and holy manna
        <br>will be showered all around.
        <br><br>VERSE 3-Sisters, will you join and help us?
        <br>Moses’ sister aided him.
        <br>Will you help the trembling mourners,
        <br>who are struggling hard with sin?
        <br>Tell them all about the Savior-
        <br>tell them that He will be found.
        <br>Sisters, pray, and holy manna
        <br>will be showered all around.
        <br><br>VERSE 4-Is there here a trembling jailer,
        <br>seeking grace and filled with fears?
        <br>Is there here a weeping Mary,
        <br>pouring forth a flood of tears?
        <br>Brethren, join your cries to help them;
        <br>sisters, let your prayers abound!
        <br>Pray, O pray, that holy manna
        <br>may be scattered all around.
        <br><br>VERSE 5-Let us love our God supremely.
        <br>Let us love each other too.
        <br>Let us love and pray for sinners,
        <br>till our God makes all things new.
        <br>Then He’ll call us home to Heaven-
        <br>at His table we’ll sit down.
        <br>Christ will gird Himself and serve us
        <br>with sweet manna all around.
