        VERSE 1-Praise ye the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
        <br>O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
        <br>All ye who hear,
        <br>now to His temple draw near;
        <br>join me in glad adoration.
        <br><br>VERSE 2-Praise ye the Lord, Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
        <br>shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
        <br>Hast thou not seen
        <br>how thy desires e'er have been
        <br>granted in what He ordaineth?
        <br><br>VERSE 3-Praise ye the Lord, who with marvelous wisdom hath made thee!
        <br>Decked thee with health, and with loving hand guided and stayed thee.
        <br>How oft in grief
        <br>hath not He brought thee relief,
        <br>spreading His wings for to shade thee?
        <br><br>VERSE 4-Praise ye the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee.
        <br>Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
        <br>Ponder anew
        <br>what the Almighty can do,
        <br>who with His love doth befriend thee.
        <br><br>VERSE 5-Praise ye the Lord, Who, when darkness of sin is abounding,
        <br>Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,
        <br>sheddeth His light,
        <br>chaseth the horrors of night,
        <br>saints with His mercy surrounding.
        <br><br>VERSE 6-Praise ye the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!
        <br>All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him.
        <br>Let the amen
        <br>sound from His people again;
        <br>gladly for aye we adore Him.
