        VERSE 1-O worship the King, all glorious above,
        <br>O gratefully sing His power and His love;
        <br>our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days,
        <br>pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.
        <br><br>VERSE 2-O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
        <br>Whose robe is the light, Whose canopy space.
        <br>His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
        <br>and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
        <br><br>VERSE 3-The earth with its store of wonders untold,
        <br>Almighty, Thy pow'r hath founded of old:
        <br>established it fast by a changeless decree,
        <br>and round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.
        <br><br>VERSE 4-Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
        <br>It breathes in the air, it shines in the light.
        <br>it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
        <br>and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.
        <br><br>VERSE 5-Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
        <br>in Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail.
        <br>Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end:
        <br>our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.
        <br><br>VERSE 6-O measureless might! Ineffable love!
        <br>While angels delight to hymn Thee above,
        <br>the humbler creation, though feeble their lays,
        <br>with true adoration shall all sing Thy praise.
