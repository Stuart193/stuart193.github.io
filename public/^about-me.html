            <a class="header1">My early years<br></a>
            <a class="story1">I was born in southern West Virginia (yes, that means I'm a Southerner!) into a good
                Christian home. Both of my parents are strong Christians, and I'm very thankful for having such good
                influences and examples in my life. I was saved around age 6 or 7. After hearing a message in church and
                talking with my mother, I knew I needed Christ as my Savior, and I asked Him into my heart. My 3
                siblings are also all saved, with my brother actually receiving Jesus the same evening as I.<br><br></a>
            <a class="header2">My growing-up years<br></a>
            <a class="story2">When I was 9, my family and I moved to West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, to be nearer
                family. This has been a blessing! We found a good church, and I've gone through much growth in the years
                since I was saved. These were my formative years. More and more I came to appreciate the Christian home
                and heritage I've been blessed with.<br><br></a>
            <a class="header3">My recent years<br></a>
            <a class="story3">For several years, starting around age 14, I had been feeling God's tugging on my (sadly
                resistant) heart to surrender to His will for my life. After resisting for several years, I gave my life
                and direction to Christ, and asked for a calling. After a missions conference's impact on me, and the
                accumulated impact of my pastor's example, I found the Lord to be calling me to ministry. I've been
                blessed with a peace about this calling, and my time at BJU has only cemented that assurance. I'm
                looking forward to the Lord's working in and thru me at BJU and especially in larger life.<br><br>
